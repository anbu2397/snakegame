# snakegame
Welcome to the Snake Game in Java Git repository! This repository hosts a classic arcade-style game implemented in Java, where you control a snake that grows in length by eating food while avoiding collisions with the boundaries of the game screen and its own tail.


Features of the Snake Game:

Snake Movement: Control the snake's movement using arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to navigate around the game screen.

Food Generation: Randomly generated food appears on the game screen, and the snake must consume it to grow longer.

Scoring System: Keep track of your score as you eat food. The score increases with each food item consumed.

Collision Detection: Prevent the snake from colliding with the boundaries of the game screen or its own tail, as doing so will result in game over.

Game Over : When the snake collides with a boundary or its own tail, the game ends. 

This repository contains the complete source code of the Snake Game, along with any required dependencies and resources. You can clone the repository to your local machine, explore the code, and run the game on your Java development environment.
